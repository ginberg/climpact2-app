### About ClimPACT2
ClimPACT2 is an R software package that calculates the ET-SCI indices, as well as additional climate extremes indices. It directly incorporates the R climdex.pcic package (available on CRAN) to perform most of the calculations. Climdex.pcic is available thanks to the efforts of the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC). ClimPACT2 is developed at the University of New South Wales.
