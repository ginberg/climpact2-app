<p class=auto-style3>At the first meeting of the ET-SCI in Tarragona, Spain in
July 2011, the following Terms of Reference (ToR) and deliverables were agreed
as follows are: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Develop methods and tools including standardized
software for, and to generate, sector-specific climate indices, including their
time series based on historical data, and methodologies to define simple and
complex climate risks; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Promote the use of sector-specific climate
indices to bring out variability and trends in climate of particular interest
to socio-economic sectors (e.g., droughts), with global consistency and to help
characterize the susceptibility of various sectors to climate;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Develop the training materials needed to raise
capacity and promote uniform approaches around the world in applying these
techniques;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Work with sector-based agencies and experts,
including those of relevant WMO Technical Commissions, particularly the
Commission for Hydrology (CHy) and the Commission for Agricultural Meteorology
(CAgM), to facilitate the use of climate information in users’ decision-support
systems for climate risk management and adaptation strategies;</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p class=auto-style3>Submit reports in accordance with timetables
established by the OPACE 4 co-chairs.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>In addition various deliverables were proposed for
consideration by the Team. These included:</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>A collection and analysis of existing climate
indices with particular specific sectoral (agriculture, water, health and
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)) applications at national and regional scales; </p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Technical publication on climate indices for
sectoral application in risk assessment and adaptation;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Methods and tools, standardized software and
associated training materials required to produce sector-specific climate
indices for systematic assessment of the impact of climate variability and
change and to facilitate climate risk management and adaptation (to be done in
collaboration with WMO Technical Commissions, particularly CCl OPACE-2 and with
relevant agencies and organizations if required;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Pilot training workshop (at least one region) on
development of the indices;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class=auto-style3>Workshop Report/Publication.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
