line-height:150%'><span class="auto-style13">The ET-SCI, formerly known as the Expert Team on Climate Risk
and Sector-specific Indices (ET-CRSCI) was set up by the Fifteenth session of
the WMO Technical Commission for Climatology (CCl-XV, Antalya, Turkey, February
2010), with terms of reference established to support eventual implementation
of the Global Framework for Climate Services (<a href="http://www.gfcs-climate.org/">GFCS</a>).
 
Following the sixteenth World Meteorological Congress in May 2011 where a 
decision was made by WMO members to implement the GFCS, the ET-SCI held their 
first meeting in Tarragona, Spain (13-15 July, 2011). </span></span></p>

	1.1 Role of ET-SCI in GFCS</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>The ET-SCI sits within CCl under the Open Panel of CCl Experts
(OPACE) on Climate Information for Adaptation and Risk Management (OPACE-4).
The objective of OPACE-4 is to improve decision-making for planning,
operations, risk management and for adaptation to both climate change and
variability (covering time scales from seasonal to centennial) and will be
achieved through a higher level of climate knowledge, as well as by access to
and use of actionable information and products, tailored to meet their needs.
Activities primarily focus on the development of tailored climate information,
products and services for user application in adaptation and risk management,
and building interfaces with user groups to facilitate GFCS implementation.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>The work of OPACE-4 is multidisciplinary, and requires close
collaboration with experts from various socio-economic sectors. In keeping with
the priorities agreed for initial implementation of the GFCS, the core priority
sectors for consideration by the OPACE in this present intersessional period
are agriculture/food security, water and health. This requires close
collaboration with relevant experts in these sectors including seeking guidance
and aid from the WMO Technical Commissions for Agricultural Meteorology (<a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/agm/cagm/cagm_en.php">CAgM</a>)
and Hydrology (<a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/hwrp/index_en.php">CHy</a>) and with the World Health Organisation (<a href="http://www.who.int/en/">WHO</a>). </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>The ET-SCI Terms of Reference (ToR) and expected deliverables
are shown in Appendix A. The deliverables include the collection and analysis
of existing sector-relevant climate indices in addition to developing the tools
required to produce them. At a meeting in Tarragona in 2011, members of the
former ET-CRSCI invited sector and Commission representatives to help define a
suite of indices that would represent a “core set” that would meet the ToR and
deliverables. This manual outlines the rationale behind the creation of those
indices and the ClimPACT2 software developed for their calculation. </p>

<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Monthly averages of climate data smooth over a lot of
important information that is relevant for sectoral impacts. For this reason
indices derived from daily data are an attempt to objectively extract
information from daily weather observations to answer questions concerning
aspects of the climate system that affect many human and natural systems with
particular emphasis on extremes. Such indices might reflect the duration or
amplitude of heat waves, extreme rainfall intensity and frequency or measures
of extremely wet or dry/hot or cold periods that have socio-economic impacts.
Climate indices provide valuable information contained in daily data, without
the need to transmit the daily data itself. </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Much progress has been made in recent decades through
internationally agreed indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation
that represent more extreme aspects of the climate, overseen by the
CCl/WCRP/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (<a href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/etccdi">ETCCDI</a>).
Development and analyses of these indices has made a significant contribution
to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (<a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a>) Assessment Reports.</p>

	<span class="auto-style7">1.3 Background to ETCCDI, Indices and Software</span></span></p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>The ETCCDI started in 1999 and is co-sponsored by the World
Climate Research Program (<a href="http://www.wcrp-climate.org/">WCRP</a>) and <a href="http://www.jcomm.info/">JCOMM</a>. They developed an internationally
coordinated set of core climate indices consisting of <a href="http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml">27 descriptive indices</a>
for moderate extremes (Alexander et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2011). These indices
were developed with the ‘detection and attribution’ research community in mind.
In order to detect changes in climate extremes, it was important to develop a
set of indices that were statistically robust, covered a wide range of
climates, and had a high signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, internationally
agreed indices derived from daily temperature and precipitation allowed results
to be compared consistently across different countries and also had the
advantage of overcoming most of the restrictions on the dissemination of daily
data that apply in many countries. </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>ETCCDI recognized that a two-pronged approach was needed to
promote further work on the monitoring and analysis of daily climate records to
identify trends in extreme climate events (Peterson and Manton, 2008). In
addition to the formulation of indices described above, a second prong was to
promote the analysis of extremes around the world, particularly in less
developed countries, by organizing regional climate change workshops that
provided training for the local experts and conducted data analysis. The goals
of these workshops are to: contribute to worldwide indices database; build
capacity to analyse observed changes in extremes; improve information services
on extremes in the region; and publish peer-reviewed journal articles. Most of
these articles were directly a result of the regional workshops and included
all of the workshop participants as authors (e.g. Peterson et al. 2002; Vincent
et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2005; Haylock et al. 2006; Klein Tank et al. 2006;
New et al. 2006; Aguilar et al, 2006, Aguilar et al. 2009; Caesar et al. 2011;
Vincent et al. 2011).</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style11 style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:150%'><span class="auto-style13">As part of the workshop development, software called <a href="http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/software.shtml">RClimDEX</a>
was also developed that could be used at the workshops (thus providing
consistent definitions from each workshop and region). Environment Canada
provides, maintains, and further develops the R-based software used for the
workshops (freely available from <a href="http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org">http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org</a>).

	</span> <span class="auto-style7">1.4 Background to Development of ET-SCI Indices</span></span></p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Most ETCCDI indices focus on counts of days crossing a
threshold; either absolute/fixed thresholds or percentile/variable thresholds
relative to local climate. Others focus on absolute extreme values such as the
warmest, coldest or wettest day of the year. The indices are used for both
observations and models, globally as well as regionally, and can be coupled
with simple trend analysis techniques, and standard detection and attribution
methods in addition to complementing the analysis of more rare extremes using
Extreme Value Theory (EVT). </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>One current disadvantage of the ETCCDI indices is that few of
them are specifically sector-relevant. While some of these indices may be
useful for sector applications (e.g. number of days with frost for agricultural
applications, heat waves for health applications) it was realised that it was
important to get sectors involved in the development of the ET-SCI indices so
that more application-relevant indices could be developed to better support
adaptation.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>The core set of indices agreed by the ET-SCI (as the
ET-CRSCI) at their meeting in Tarragona, Spain in July 2011 were developed in
part from the core set of indices that are developed and maintained by ETCCDI.
The meeting included technical experts in climate and health and climate and
agriculture from CCl and CAgM representing the health representatives from the health,
water and agriculture sectors and it was agreed that the initial effort should
consider requirements for climate indices relevant to heat waves and droughts.
A core set of 34 indices was agreed at that meeting (Table B1). In some cases
these indices are already part of the core set defined by the ETCCDI. All
indices calculated by ClimPACT2 are shown in Appendix B and are separated into
core and non-core ET-SCI indices. In addition, there is some scope in the
ClimPACT2 software for the user to create their own index based on absolute
thresholds.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>It should be noted that indices development is an ongoing
activity as additional sector-needs arise and other sectors are considered within the Terms of Reference and deliverables of the ET-SCI. This
should therefore be seen only as the initial step in the continuing work of the
ET-SCI.</p>

	</span> <span class="auto-style7">1.5 Requirements for data quality when computing indices</span></span></p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Before indices can be computed, it is important that any
daily input data are checked for quality and homogeneity. Homogeneity implies
consistency of a series through time and is an obvious requirement for the
robust analysis of climate time series. While many of the time series that are
used for indices calculations have been adjusted to improve homogeneity, some
aspects of these records may remain inhomogeneous, and this should be borne in
mind when interpreting changes in indices. For example, most methods for
assessing homogeneity do not consider changes in day-to-day variability or
changes in how the series has been derived. It is possible for a change of
variance to occur without a change in mean temperature. Two examples of ways in
which this could occur are where a station moves from an exposed coastal
location to a location further inland, increasing maximum temperatures and
decreasing minimum temperatures, or where the number of stations contributing
to a composite series changes. </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Homogeneity adjustment of daily data is difficult because of
high variability in the daily data when compared with monthly or annual data,
and also because an inhomogeneity due to a change in station location or
instrument may alter behaviour differently under different weather conditions.
Homogeneity adjustment of daily data is a very active field of research and
there are many methods which could be used. Although many different methods
exists, the ETCCDI promote the use of the RHTest software* because it is free
and easy to use, making it ideal for demonstration in regional workshops. The
software method is based on the penalized maximal t (PMT) or F test (PMF) and
can identify, and adjust for, multiple change points in a time series (see
Wang, 2008 and ETCCDI website for more details). PMT requires the use of reference
stations for the homogeneity analysis but PMF can be used as an absolute method
(i.e. in isolation or when there are no neighbouring stations to use for
comparison). In ClimPACT2, apart from basic quality control, there is currently
no means to homogenise data. We therefore assume that the required level of
homogeneity testing and/or adjustment has already been applied.  </p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>*NB Daily adjustments, especially with absolute methods, must
be applied with extreme care as – if incorrectly applied – they can damage the
statistical distribution of the series. Therefore, data require careful
post-workshop analysis in concert with metadata (where available) and as such
ET-SCI recommend that any homogeneity software used at regional workshops is
for demonstration purposes only.</p>

	1.6 Future prospects for the Indices</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>At present the core set of indices are defined using only
daily maximum temperature (TX), daily minimum temperature (TN) and daily
precipitation (PR). It is acknowledged that for sector applications, these variables
(and the related indices) are all required, but users have also indicated a
need for additional variables including: humidity (important for both
agricultural and health indices); wind speed and direction (important for
health indices, building design, energy, transportation, etc.); Sea Surface
Temperatures (SSTs; useful for marine applications and in relation to the onset
and variability of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)); onset and
cessation dates for monsoon; rain periods, snow fall, snow depth, snow-water
equivalent, days with snowfall and hydrological parameters (particularly
important for mid-and high latitude applications). Some of these (e.g. onset
dates) may require considerable study and available systematic long-term data.
Furthermore, in a subsequent phase of the work of the Team, addition of ‘event
statistics’ such as days with thunderstorms, hail, tornados, number of
consecutive days with snowfall, etc., for expanded studies of hazards could be
considered. The ET-SCI will consider (at a later date) whether to add these new
variables to the dataset as a second level priority.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>ET-SCI also feels that it is important to add several complex
indices to this initial effort (for example heat waves), but recognized that
more could be demanded by (or may be in current use by) sectors, once they are
consulted on the process and through training. The development of indices to
assess multi-day temperature extremes (e.g., prolonged heat waves) has been
particularly challenging, as the occurrence of such events depends not just on
the frequency distribution of daily temperatures, but also on their persistence
from day to day. The existing ETCCDI indices measure the maximum number of
consecutive days during events with six or more consecutive days above a
specified percentile value or anomaly, vary widely in frequency across
climates, describe events that occur rarely or not at all in many climates, and
are poor discriminators of very extreme events. The ET-SCI are therefore
recommending some new heat wave indices (see Appendix B; Perkins and Alexander,
2013 and Perkins et al. 2012) that have been added as a supplement to the core
set in this initial phase of the software. This range of indices is defined for
most climates and has a number of other desirable statistical properties, such
as being approximately normally distributed in many climates.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Also drought indices have been included following ET-SCI
recommendations. Since drought severity is difficult to quantify and is identified
by its effects or impacts on different types of systems (e.g. agriculture,
water resources, ecology, forestry, economy), different proxies have been
developed based on climatic information. These are assumed to adequately
quantify the degree of drought hazard exerted on sensitive systems. Recent
studies have reviewed the development of drought indices and compared their
advantages and disadvantages (Heim, 2002; Mishra and Singh, 2010; Sivakumar et
al., 2010). Currently ClimPACT2 includes the Standardized Precipitation Index
(SPI), proposed by McKee et al. (1993), and accepted by the WMO as the
reference drought index for more effective drought monitoring and climate risk
management (World Meteorological Organization, 2012), and the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), proposed by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010),
which combines the sensitivity to changes in evaporative demand, caused by
temperature fluctuations and trends, with the simplicity of calculation and the
multi-temporal nature of the SPI.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>In a subsequent phase, ET-SCI will investigate additional
complex indices combining meteorological variables (e.g. temperature and
humidity for physiological comfort), and could consider indices that combine
meteorological/hydrological parameters with sector-based information including
measures of vulnerability.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Much of the input for additional indices will come from regional workshops with participants from both National Meteorological and 
Hydrological Services (NMHSs) and sector groups. ET-SCI will work with 
sector-based agencies and experts, including those of relevant WMO Technical 
Commissions, particularly the Commission for Climatology for health, the 
Commission for Hydrology (CHy) for water and the Commission for Agricultural 
Meteorology (CAgM) for agriculture and food security, to facilitate the use of 
climate information in users’ decision-support systems for climate risk 
management and adaptation strategies. As part of this development, ET-SCI 
commissioned the development of ClimPACT2 with the aim of producing 
an easy and consistent way of calculating indices for each user, with regional workshop users particularly in mind. To date workshops have been held in Ecuador, Fiji and Barbados. An example of an ET-SCI workshop can be found <a
href="https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/opace/opace4/meetings/ET-SCI-fiji2015.php">here</a>.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>It is also acknowledged that updating indices is problematic
for many regions and some regions would need specific indices to cope with
their particular needs to provide climate services. As GFCS stresses the
importance of the global, regional and local scales, ET-SCI acknowledges that
support for this could come from Regional Climate Centers (RCCs) or Regional
Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs) etc. In addition, there are constraints on
access to daily data. It is a considerable challenge to assemble worldwide
datasets which are integrated, quality controlled, and openly and easily
accessible. There is tension between traceability (access to the primary
sources) and data completeness (use whatever available). Also a problem arises
through the use of specified climatological periods which vary from group to
group and which are used for base period calculations for percentile-based
indices. In the first iteration of the software we use the base period of
1971-2000 but recognise that this will need to be amended for countries that do
not have records covering this period. The software has been written in such a
way that the user can specify the climatological base period which is most suitable
for their data.</p>
<br/>
<p class=auto-style15>Users are invited to view ClimPACT2 as ‘living software’ in
that it can and will be amended as additional user needs arise. </p>
